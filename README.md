This is my entirely project that I was practicing how to implement a design that I had done using figma. The purpose of this project was to see if I can produce a coding 
that duly respect my design or not. However, I found out that it is very possible to produce a better product architecture for any design. The project is about coming
up with a front-end design of a website system.
